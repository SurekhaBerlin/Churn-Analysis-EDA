# Churn-Analysis-EDA

1. BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING & OVERVIEW
   
	Telecom Industry is a highly competitive industry. So, customer retention is very important. In the telecom industry, customers can easily choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences a significant annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition. So, the main aim of this industry is to prevent the customer from churning. Various analysis can be conducted for predicting which customers are at high risk of churn.
Customer Churn means whether the customer has stopped using the product and switched to a competitor product. To prevent customers from churning, we can use data analysis to identify potential features and design strategies to prevent customers from leaving. It is also noted that an already loyal customer is less likely to churn and easier to retain than try gaining a new customer.
In this project I am analyzing the customer level data of a leading telecom industry to come up with  insights into the main indicators of the churn and conclusion.
The dataset I am using is for a project purpose. The name of the dataset is (Customer-Churn.csv). Each row represents a customer; each column contains the customer’s attributes, customer ID, gender, Senior Citizen, Partner, Dependents, tenure, Phone Service, Multiple Lines, Internet Service, Online Security, Online Backup, Device Protection, Tech Support, Streaming TV,  Streaming Movies, Contract, Paperless Billing, Payment Method, Monthly Charges, Total Charges, Churn.
